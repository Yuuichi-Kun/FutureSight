This web is still in progress.

The name is FutureSight and its a tracer study web, it can track someone who already graduate from their highschool and keep in check where they working at.
This is a project for my school final test. All my project are open source so you can copy it whenever you want for your need though a star will be appreciated :)

Instruction:

1. Composer install
2. npm install && npm run build
3. cp .env.example .env
4. php artisan migrate
5. php artisan db:seed --class=CreateUsersSeeder
6. php artisan db:seed --class=StatusAlumniSeeder
7. php artisan key:generate
8. php artisan serve
9. npm build dev

UPDATE: It's finally done! I have done most of it and the web can be considered done.
